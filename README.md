## About The Project

[![our app in action][product-screenshot]](http://146.59.196.47/)

This is a web app that lets any user look up their French township to get information about the township's digital fragility level.
This indicator is calculated from data ranging from the age and digital knowhow of inhabitants, to the actual hardware coverage available in the region. More information about the criteria for this rating can be found [here](https://indice.institutnr.org/#indicateur).

As part of the Design 4 Green initiative, we have strived to reduce the amount of data moving between clients and the server, and only send the client the data that he strictly requires, nothing more, nothing less.

This project is an entry to the 2020 Design 4 Green 48H hackathon.
